The Littlebot stack is an exciting and versatile package group to configure the Littlebot robot - a low-cost educational robot developed specifically for learning the principles of robotics. With a focus on simplicity, affordability, and educational value, the Littlebot robot serves as an ideal platform for students, hobbyists, and educators to delve into the fascinating world of robotics.

**Key Features:**

- Educational Focus: The Littlebot robot is purpose-built to help beginners grasp fundamental robotics concepts in a hands-on and engaging manner.
- ROS2 Compatibility: Leveraging the power of ROS2, the stack allows for efficient communication, control, and integration with various robotic components.
- Configurability: Customize the Littlebot robot's behavior and capabilities through easy-to-use configuration options provided by the ROS2 package.
- Extensibility: Expand the Littlebot's capabilities by adding your own ROS2 nodes and integrating additional sensors and actuators.

Whether you are a student embarking on your robotics journey or an educator seeking an accessible platform for teaching robotics, the Littlebot ROS2 stack empowers you to explore, experiment, and learn in a fun and interactive manner.


**Simulation**: For those interested in simulating the Littlebot robot, we have a dedicated repository that provides details and resources for simulating the Littlebot using the powerful Gazebo simulation environment. You can find the simulation repository at the following link:

[lttleBOT Gazebo](https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot_gazebo)

Please refer to the simulation repository for instructions on setting up the Littlebot simulation and exploring its capabilities virtually.

**Hardware**: This repository serves as the ROS2 package for configuring the Littlebot robot. If you are interested in the hardware specifications and assembly instructions, please refer to the hardware documentation provided separately at the following link:

 [littleBOT firmware](https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot_firmware)

Get started by following the installation instructions below to set up the Littlebot ROS2 package on your system. We welcome contributions from the community to enhance and improve the Littlebot robot, making robotics education accessible to everyone.

<!-- ## Testando o Littlebot

Estas instruções te ajudarão a fazer os primeiros testes com a plataforma Littlebot -->

<!-- ### Pré-requisitos

Para testar o Littlebot em seu sistema você precisa ter instalado o ROS ([melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic) recomendado). Um erro pode acontecer ao tentar vizualizar o modelo no RVIZ no ROS-melodic, caso isso ocorra, pode ser necessário mudar uma variável de ambiente, como segue abaixo: -->

<!-- ```bash
export LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
``` -->

<!-- ### Rodando a simulação

Para simular o Littlebot, o primeiro passo é criar um [workspace ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/littlebot_ws/src
cd littlebot_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Após criar o workspace fazer o clone do repositório

```bash
cd src
git clone https://github.com/NestorDP/littlebot.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Para rodar a simulção no Gazebo

```bash
roslaunch littlebot_gazebo gazebo.launch
``` -->
