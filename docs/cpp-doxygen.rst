C++ API (Doxygen via Breathe)
==============================

The C++ API documentation is generated by Doxygen and imported with Breathe.
If the Doxygen XML is available, the top-level index will be shown below.

.. note:: The Read the Docs build runs `doxygen Doxyfile` in the `docs` folder
   as a pre-build step so the XML should be generated automatically.
